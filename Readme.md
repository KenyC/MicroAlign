MicroAlign
============================

A minimal alignment package for Sublime Text 3/4. Strictly worse than the competition.

## Usage

 1. Select multiple things
 2. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> (or <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>).
 3. Inserts as many spaces before selection as needed so that the left edges of all selection regions are on the same columnn.
